This is an academic package on DBMS.
I have used PostgreSQL for the backend and Python with PyQt for the front end.

Objective: To imitate a Massive Online Open Courses(M.O.O.C.) platform,
           simulating the functionalities of student, lecturer and administrator.
           
Note: page1.py is the main program.
